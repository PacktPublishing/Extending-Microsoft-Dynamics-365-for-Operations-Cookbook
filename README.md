The information in this book will help you shorten your learning curve on how to program for the NAV 2017 ERP system using the C/AL language, the C/SIDE integrated development environment, and their capabilities. We hope you enjoy working with NAV as much as we have.
Each new version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV is the result of inspiration and hard work along with some good fortune and expert technical investment over the last thirty years.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter03.

The code will look like the following:

```
"Sales Line".SETRANGE("Document Type","Sales Header"."Document Type");
"Sales Line".SETRANGE("Document No.","Sales Header"."No.");
"Sales Line".CALCSUMS(Amount);
TotalOrderAmount := "Sales Line".Amount;
```
